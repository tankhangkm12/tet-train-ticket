The design chain spans many sessions; this file is the project's memory of why things are the way they are.

- **Decided by** is the most important column. Agent choices must carry `[agent-chosen — needs review]`
  and be listed at the top of the stage doc's Assumptions & risks.
- **Affects** tells which docs to re-check if this row changes.
- Changing an earlier decision: add a new row with "Replaces D-02" — never delete history; then check
  every doc in the old row's Affects, print the conflict table (`traceability.md`), ask whether to
  apply. **Never cascade edits automatically**; the owner must see the blast radius first.
